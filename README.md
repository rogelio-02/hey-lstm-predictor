# Hey LSTM Predictor
Recurrent Neural Network for Recurrent Payment Detection
This project implements a recurrent neural network (RNN) using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) layers to detect recurrent payments for Hey Banco customers. The model is trained on historical transaction data to identify temporal patterns associated with specific merchants, and to estimate payment amounts and periodicity.
